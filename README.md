 # Prework Study Guide Webpage
A study guide for course pre-work

## Description

This is a personal study guide for the work I did before the boot camp started. My motivation for this is to study for a new career in tech. I built this website because I needed a place that I could review and go over my notes on the topics we went over during prework. This helps me because it is that an organized space to review my notes that I recorded during this time. Doing this helped me learn the beginning stages of how to build a website. It'll take time and effort but I believe that I can improve over time.
